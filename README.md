# Capital One Offer Sorter

A lightweight Firefox extension that automatically sorts Capital One Shopping offers based on mileage rewards.

By default, the extension will:
- Load all available offers
- Sort them so that higher-mileage offers appear first
- Optionally revert to the original order with a toggle

ðŸ§  Built to work dynamically with the Capital One Shopping interface using real-time DOM observation.
